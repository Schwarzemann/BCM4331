# RTL8139
A simple driver for Realtek RTL8139 Chipset that is designed for Linux.
Nothing too fancy for sure. It cannot be a replacement for the real driver.


## Hardware Registers

### Unicast Filter Registers

  Provides information about the media status, including link status and speed.

- **CONFIG_REG_3 (0x59)**:  
  Used for additional configuration settings, often related to power management and wake-on-LAN.

- **CONFIG_REG_4 (0x5A)**:  
  Similar to CONFIG_REG_3, this register is used for various configuration tasks, including advanced features.

- **MULTI_INT_SELECT (0x5C)**:  
  Allows selection of which interrupts are active when multiple interrupt conditions are met.

- **PCI_REVISION_ID (0x5E)**:  
  Stores the PCI revision ID, identifying the specific version of the network card.

- **TX_STATUS_ALL_DESC (0x60)**:  
  Provides the status for all transmit descriptors.

### PHY Registers
- **BASIC_MODE_CTRL_REG (0x62)**:  
  Controls the basic operation mode of the PHY, such as setting speed and duplex.

- **BASIC_MODE_STATUS_REG (0x64)**:  
  Displays the status of the PHYâ€™s basic operation, including link status and speed.

- **AUTO_NEG_ADVERT_REG (0x66)**:  
  Contains the capabilities of the network card advertised during auto-negotiation.

- **AUTO_NEG_LINK_PARTNER (0x68)**:  
  Shows the capabilities of the link partner during auto-negotiation.
